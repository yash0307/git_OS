This is complete shell, uses execvp for executing commands. Doesnt support background processes. cd, echo and pwd are implemented using lib calls as these are builtin functions


Status - Evaluation done. Got bonus marks.

-> Execute, shell commands also separated by ';' eg : (cd dir ; ls )
-> Env vars for echo.
